SMH Linton Besser reveals that secret plan by Labor gov to revive M4 East which was dropped after massive opposition in 2005. Underground tollways 

“Vast underground intersections are being planned for heritage suburbs such as Glebe, Rozelle Bay and Haberfield, requiring a string of exhaust ventilation stacks.

In all, the project will include at least 14-kilometres of tollway that would connect the M4 at North Strathfield with the Anzac Bridge, the airport and Victoria Road at Drummoyne”
